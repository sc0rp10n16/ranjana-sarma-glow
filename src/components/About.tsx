                I'm Ranjana Sarma, a mission-adaptable professional with a diverse skill set spanning science, management, law, education, and community health. My journey is rooted in a deep commitment to empowermentâ€”whether it's guiding first-generation learners, designing inclusive futures, or navigating global conversations around safety, legacy, and learning.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                With a PhD in Biochemistry and a Postgraduate Diploma in Patent Law, I began my career in STEM with a rigorous foundation in intellectual inquiry and innovation. Over time, I complemented this with an MBA in General Management, equipping myself with the tools of strategy, financial modeling, and audit clarityâ€”skills that translate into boardroom decision-making, family enterprise advisement, and sustainable growth planning.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                For the past several years, I've also served as a Career Counsellor and Communications Mentor with Freedom Employability Academy, working with underprivileged youth to build confidence, purpose, and life skills. Teaching is not a role for meâ€”it's a relationship. That ethos extends to my work as a Certified Teacher of Swimming and Water Safety through AUSTSWIM (Australia), where I bring confidence and safety to the water, particularly for women, children, and underserved communities.

                  My career is not defined by a single industryâ€”but by a single question: <em>"What does this moment need, and how can I serve with skill, empathy, and clarity?"</em>

                In 2010, I nearly drowned in an eddy current on the Madison River near Yellowstone National Park. A strangerâ€”my guardian angelâ€”pulled me out. That moment changed the course of my life.
